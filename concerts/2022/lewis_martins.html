<p>Cellist <a href="https://www.gabrielmartinscello.com">Gabriel Martins</a> (b. 1998) has established himself
as one of the world’s most enthralling young artists, with a deep commitment to the timeless
masterpieces of classical music. His artistry has already been recognized through an extensive
list of accolades including the 2020 Concert Artists Guild - Young Classical Artists Trust Grand
Prize, the 2020 Sphinx Competition Gold Medal, the David Popper International Cello Competition
Gold Medal, the International Tchaikovsky Competition for Young Musicians Silver Medal, the
Schadt String Competition Gold Medal, the Orford Music Award, and the Prague Spring Czech Music
Fund Prize. These successes have lead to a number of high-profile debuts including Wigmore,
Carnegie, and Merkin Halls, the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, Maison Symphonique in
Montréal, and the Arkansas, Memphis, Indianapolis, New Russian State, Pacific, and Phoenix
Symphony Orchestras. According to legendary cellist Ralph Kirshbaum, he has “revealed heart,
passion, intellect, and a finely-nuanced palette of colors in a compelling manner worthy of a
seasoned artist.”</p>

<p>Born of American and Brazilian heritage, Martins grew up in Bloomington, Indiana. He began
playing the cello when he was five, studying with Susan Moses at the Indiana University String
Academy. He went on to receive his B.M. as a Presidential Scholar at the USC Thornton School of
Music with Ralph Kirshbaum. In his freshman year at USC, he won the school’s concerto
competition as well as its Bach competition. He received his M.M. at the New England
Conservatory of Music. His festival appearances have included Ravinia’s Steans Music Institute,
where he was also selected to tour with Miriam Fried, and the Aspen Music Festival, where he won
the Concerto Competition. He plays on a composite Francesco Ruggieri cello made in Cremona, c.
1690 and a François Nicolas Voirin bow made in Paris, c. 1880.</p>

<p>Martins resides in Boston, Massachusetts with his partner, violinist Geneva Lewis.</p>
