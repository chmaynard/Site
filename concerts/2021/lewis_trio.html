<p>Carter Johnson began the study of piano at age five with Shelley Roberts (with whom he studied for
twelve years), continued studies with Michelle Mares, and then with Mark Anderson at the University
of British Columbia, where he received a Bachelor of Music in piano performance. His areas of
special interest include the music of J.S. Bach, Brahms, Schumann, contemporary music, and art song

<p>In addition to his musical career, Johnson is an accomplished actor and speaker: he holds his ATCL
