<p>Tobias Elser began his violin studies at the age of 5 in his hometown of Ithaca, NY. He then
went on to study with Marilyn McDonald at Oberlin Conservatory for his Bachelor’s degree. It

affinity for chamber collaboration and since then he has devoted his musical focus to the
art of chamber music. While attending Oberlin he also discovered the unique thrill that
contemporary music can offer after having worked extensively with Timothy Weiss. After
graduating from Oberlin, Elser fueled this newly found passion by playing in esteemed modern
chamber music ensembles such as the International Contemporary Ensemble, and the Slee
Sinfonietta. Prior to joining the Dior Quartet, Elser attended numerous chamber music
festivals such as the Bowdoin International Music Festival and the Madeline Island Chamber
Music Festival, among others.</p>

<p>Elser then went on to receive his Master’s of Music Degree from Indiana University, under
the violin instruction of Kevork Mardirossian. It was during his first year at Indiana that
Elser and his classmates formed the Dior Quartet. During their studies, the quartet received
many awards from the Jacobs School of Music including the Kuttner Quartet Scholarship, the
Chamber Music Fellowship position, as well as 1st prize at the annual Beethoven Haus Quartet
Competition. After completing his Master’s in Violin Performance, Elser went on to receive a
Performer’s Diploma in Chamber Music, also from Indiana.</p>

<p>Since the Fall of 2021 the Dior Quartet has held the position of Quartet in Residence at the
Glenn Gould School at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. Elser plays on a violin
crafted by Jesse Maschmeyer in 2010. When he’s not rehearsing with his quartet or teaching
violin lessons, he enjoys improvising on piano, and going on hikes.</p>
