Quartet</a> (formerly known as the Arte String Quartet) is
a vibrant young ensemble based in New York City. Their name is a nod to their multicultural
origins; together, this foursome represents five continents and speaks six languages.</p>

<p>Praised for their “remarkable maturity and musicality” and “superb ensemble playing” (Hyde
Park Herald, Chicago), these four musicians, through their unique individuality as artists,
are committed to infusing the string quartet with equal parts passion, vitality, and humor.
Storytelling and spontaneity are at the heart of TSQ’s music making and they craft programs
so as to tell a unique tale about the people, places, and ideas behind great works of the
past and masterpieces of the present.</p>

<p>TSQ has performed at The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, at Alice Tully Hall
with cellist Natasha Brofsky as part of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts’s “Wednesdays
at One” series, and as part of the Four Seasons Chamber Music Festival’s Winter Workshop in
North Carolina, where they performed with Robert McDonald. They have also appeared in
concert with Quartetto di Cremona. Their mentors and coaches include Daniel Avshalomov and
Laurie Carney of the American String Quartet, Mark Steinberg and Nina Lee of the Brentano
Quartet, Ara Gregorian, Hye-Jin Kim, Philip Setzer, Calvin Wiersma, Natasha Brofsky,
Catherine Cho, and Joseph Lin.</p>
